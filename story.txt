Der Ingenieur lebt in einem Schloss und fährt einen BMW (The engineer lives in a castle and drives a BMW).
He has work in Berlin and has to head to the Flughafen in his Porsche.
He like to go to local baeckerei and buy gebaeck.
But one day, his Hund ate all the Apfelkuchen and blamed it on the Klimaanlage.
It was a shame, however, that the engineer forgot to let his Great Dane Hund (Dog) out of the BMW, because when he returns to the Schloss (Castle/palace), he is going to find some surprises.
When he opened the car door, the air smelled less like Brot and more like a failed experiment in Klimaanlage engineering.
Eines Tages, während er die Hauptstrasse entlangfuhr, sah der Ingenieur einen Hund, der Lederhosen trug. (One day, while driving down Main street, the engineer saw a dog wearing leather pants.)
