Der Ingenieur lebt in einem Schloss und f√§hrt einen BMW (The engineer lives in a castle and drives a BMW).
He has work in Berlin and has to head to the Flughafen in his Porsche.
He like to go to local baeckerei and buy gebaeck.
But one day, his Hund ate all the Apfelkuchen and blamed it on the Klimaanlage.
It was a shame, however, that the engineer forgot to let his Great Dane Hund (Dog) out of the BMW, because when he returns to the Schloss (Castle/palace), he is going to find some surprises.
